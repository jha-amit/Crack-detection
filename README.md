# Crack-detection
In a project with Aerium analytics i performed unsupervised method of carack detection in roads. We used openCV and DBSCAN to classify the image for identifying the cracks in pavement.
We experimented with different filters namely the gaussian blur, canny filter and other gradient filters.
The problem that persited was the shadow of trees and vehicles that was hard to filter out.
It is unresolved but with clear images we can identify the cracks
